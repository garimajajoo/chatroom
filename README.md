Chat Room

This is a chat room website I created using Node.JS and Socket.IO.
Users can create a chat room with an arbitrary name and any user can join any chat room. However, some chat rooms can be created that are password protected. When inside a chat room, all the useres are displayed at the top of the page. Users can temporarily kick out or permanently ban other users. Users can send a normal message in the chat room or privately message another user in the room.
